## Part 2: Code Breaking

You've intercepted a secret message that is encrypted using both of two techniques. In Replacement, each letter of the alphabet is replaced with another letter of the alphabet. (For example, all a's may have been replaced with f's, b's with z's, etc.) Unfortunately, we don't know the mapping that was used. In Rearrangement, the order of the characters is scrambled. For each consecutive sequence of n characters, the characters are reordered according to a function that maps character indices to character indices. For example, if n = 4 and the mapping function is f(0) = 2; f(1) = 0; f(2) = 1; f(3) = 3, then the string test would be rearranged to be estt (because the character at index 0 was moved to index 2, index 1 was moved to index 0, etc). We don't know the mapping function that the encoder used, but we do know that n = 4. How can we decrypt a document without knowing the encryption tables? Probabilistic methods come to the
rescue. For any given sequence of characters, we can score how \English-like" it is by viewing language as simple a Markov chain over letters of the alphabet. We can define the probability that a document D was generated from the English language, P(D) = Qi P(Wi); where Wi is the i-th word of the document, and

Now let's say we randomly applied different decryption
tables to an encrypted document. For each of those candidate decryptions D, we can calculate P(D), and
then choose the one that is highest | the one that maximizes the likelihood of the data.

Unfortunately, trying all possible tables is impossible because the number of possible codes is unthinkably
enormous | there are 26! possible replacement code books and 4! possible rearrangement codes, for a
total of about 10 trillion quadrillion combinations. Here's an alternative, based on something called the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm:
1. Start with a guess about the encryption tables. Call the guess T.
2. Modify T to produce a new guess, T0. The modification could be switching two letters in one of the
tables, for example.
3. Decrypt the encoded document using T to produce document D, and decrypt the document using T0
to produce D0.
4. If P(D0) > P(D); then replace T with T0. Otherwise, with probability P(D0)
P(D) , replace T with T0.
5. Go to step 2.

Write a program to break codes of the above type. Your program should be run like this:

```
./break_code.py encoded_document english_corpus output
```

where encoded document is the name of a encrypted file, english corpus is a document containing some
English text, and output is the file in which to write the final decrypted output. The purpose of the English
corpus is to estimate the probabilities needed to compute the probabilities above. (Intuitively, the idea is
that your program is searching for a code such that, when used to decrypt the document, the statistics of
the decrypted document match the statistics of known English text.)
Your code should output the best possible decryption it can find within a time limit of about 10 minutes.
You might want to consider variations on the above algorithm to improve performance, such as running the
algorithm multiple times and using the best (highest-probability) result. Make sure to explain these design
decisions in your report. For simplicity, you can assume that the input and output documents consist only
of lowercase letters and spaces - no punctuation or capital letters.

## Solution 


The solution has the following parts that were created - 

#### 1. Generating Initial Probabilities - 

To compute the P(W<sup>0</sup><sub>i</sub>) and P(W<sup>j+1</sup><sub>i</sub>) for all j, 2 dictionaries were created W0 and W1.
 - W0 consists of all the 26 characters and space initialized to 0
 - W1 consists of all 27*27 combinations also initialized to 0

We the count the number of times a combination occurred and stored them against that combination in the dictionary and then calculate the probabilities as 
```
P(number of times 'vf' occurred)/P(Sum of all possibilities)
```

#### 2. Scoring a file using the generated probabilities

The entire document is split into individual words and the probability of each word is computed as follows

P(W0) * P(W1|W0) * P(W2|W1) * P(Wn|Wn-1)

Sidenote - We tried splitting the entire document into words/segments of 4 characters and computed the probabilities on those. This did not give accurate picture of what can be considered "English-like" because of all the spaces in the document.

####  3. Generate Rearrangement & Replacement
Given a dictionary or list of rearrangement or replacement table, randomly pick 2 
indices and flip them 

####  4. Break Code

- Start with a random replacement and rearrangement table
- Compute the score for this combination of replacement and rearrangement tables
- To induce as much randomness as possible we alternatively choose to flip either the rearrangement table or replacement table based on a uniform distribution
- Regardless of what was changed, a score is computed and checked against the best score seen so far
- If it is greater than the best score, it is accepted set as the best replacement and rearrangement table seen so far
- If not then it is accepted with a probability P(D*)/P(D)

Also, the code terminates when the last 1000 iterations see no change accepted and have completed 20k iterations

## Alternative Approaches tried
We also tried generating scores for 24 possible permutations of the rearrangement table for each random replace table and followed the same implementation for the rest of the approach.

It was observed that although this approach did yield acceptable results it took a very long amount of time. Around 35 minutes for 20,000 iterations. 
Also, the implementation results in a good encryption around 6 out of 10 times. If when evaluating the implementation, it results in a poor encryption do give it another run.

hen in the ourse of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the aws of ature and of atures od entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation e hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their reator with certain unalienable ights that among these are ife iberty and the pursuit of appinesshat to secure these rights overnments are instituted among en deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed hat whenever any orm of overnment becomes destructive of these ends it is the ight of the eople to alter or to abolish it and to institute new overnment laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their afety and appiness rudence indeed will dictate that overnments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed ut when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same bject evinces a design to reduce them under absolute espotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such overnment and to provide new uards for their future securityuch has been the patient sufferance of these olonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former ystems of overnment he history of the present ing of reat ritain is a history of repeated injuries
